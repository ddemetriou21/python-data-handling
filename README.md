# python-data-handling

learning how to use pandas/numpy libraries in python.
learned how to be able to collect and clean up data from multiple excel files
and be able to compile the cleaned up version into 1 excel file.

I then use the excel file to try and experiment with different questions 
and see how I would be able to obtain the desired results.
once obtained in a written format I also display it through graphs with pandas.

in this folder you will find multiple excel files and the python file that will execute 
the script and compile/clean up the data from the files into one. 

(note: the commented section in my python file is what I ran the first time to be able
to clean up the data into 1 file named 2015-2024_cleaned_data.)
